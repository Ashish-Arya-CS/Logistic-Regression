# Logistic-Regression
In this repository you will get a program which deals with a logistic regression problem of machine learning.
I have built a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their results on two exams.
You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training
example, you have the applicant's scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
